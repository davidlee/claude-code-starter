# claude-code-starter

An opinionated Claude Code starter kit. Extracted from [vice](https://github.com/davidlee/vice).

Coming soon, maybe: meta-commentary / usage instructions. 

## Sync

if you made some improvements in a project using this starter kit, you can run 

```bash
.script/import-claude-files.sh your-project-name
```

to pull them into your fork of this repo, or from your project run

```bash
.script/import-claude-files.sh path-to-your-fork-of-starter
```

to incorporate them into another project. 

This stuff changes fast, so you may as well benefit from your learning on one project in your others.

## Project-Specific Stuff

Put what you want Claude to read on every boot in `doc/project-overview.md`.
